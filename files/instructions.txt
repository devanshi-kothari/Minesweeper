How to Play Minesweeper!

Mission: The goal is Minesweeper is to reveal all the cells that don't
have a bomb and to flag all the cells that have a bomb. If you click on
a cell that has a bomb, you automatically lose!

1. At the start of the game, click on a random cell to reveal it. (It is
okay if the cell that you click on initially is a bomb; just start over
by clicking "Reset")
2. If that cell is surrounded by 1 or more bombs, it will show the number
of bombs it is surrounded by in the square. This will give you a hint on
where to click next. If that cell is not surrounded by a bomb, it will
reveal more cells that you are given more hints on where the bombs are.
3. Use these hints to reveal even more cells and flag all the locations
where you think the bombs are.
4. You win if all the flag locations match up with all the bomb locations
and all the empty cells are revealed!

Happy Minesweeping & Good Luck!! :)
